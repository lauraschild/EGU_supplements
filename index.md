## Poster figures with example record

Some records show the patterns we observed especially well. One of those is this record in Poland.

The following set of figures are the same ones as presented on the poster and highlight the Polish record.

![loess](/richness_assymetry/figures/Fig_1_B_polish-1.png){: width="75%"}

The record starts on a forest gain trajectory. Its richness tends to decrease with forest increases and only rises again with constant forest cover or forest cover loss. during this time the record roughly aligns with the blue loess model. After reaching its maximum forest cover it goes on to a forest loss trajectory. Its richness tends to increase and is much higher than at eqivalent forest covers on the forest gain trajectory.

Forest loss is associated with richness gain in the Polish example record as can be seen from the negative slope of the richness change - forest cover change relationship.

The example record generally moved from a grassland system to deciducous forest and then to a shrubby meadow. Samples with past forest cover loss have a higher richness in all PCA quadrants.

## Regional differences

The observed patterns differ a bit regionally and are strongest in Europe.
