## Poster figures with example record

Some records show the patterns we observed especially well. One of those is this record in Poland.

The following set of figures are the same ones as presented on the poster and highlight the Polish record.

The record starts on a forest gain trajectory. Its richness tends to decrease with forest increases and only rises again with constant forest cover or forest cover loss. during this time the record roughly aligns with the blue loess model. After reaching its maximum forest cover it goes on to a forest loss trajectory. Its richness tends to increase and is much higher than at eqivalent forest covers on the forest gain trajectory.

Forest loss is associated with richness gain in the Polish example record as can be seen from the negative slope of the richness change - forest cover change relationship.

The example record generally moved from a grassland system to deciducous forest and then to a shrubby meadow. Samples with past forest cover loss have a higher richness in all PCA quadrants.

## Regional differences

The observed patterns differ a bit regionally and are strongest in Europe.

## Data Sources

Source pollen data is available on PANGAEA.
- Li, Chenzhi; Ni, Jian; Böhmer, Thomas; Cao, Xianyong; Zhou, Borui; Liao, Megna; Li, Kai; Herzschuh, Ulrike: LegacyPollen2.0: an updated global taxonomically and temporally standardized fossil pollen dataset of 3728 palynological records [dataset]. PANGAEA, https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.965907

Forest cover was derived from corrected pollen data and is available on PANGAEA as well.
- Herzschuh, Ulrike; Ewald, Peter; Schild, Laura; Li, Chenzhi; Böhmer, Thomas (2023): Global REVEALS reconstruction of past vegetation cover for taxonomically harmonized pollen data sets [dataset publication series]. PANGAEA, https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.961588

Richness was derived from the source pollen data and describes the number of species present in a sample. We furthermore corrected for grain counts, as more grains counted will statistically result in more species detected.

## About me

![me](/richness_assymetry/figures/IMG_3938.JPG){: width="75%"}

I'm **Laura Schild**, an environmental scientist (B.Sc.) and conservation biologist (M.Sc.) with a focus on and passion for data science. 
I'm a third-year PhD student in the working groups for *High-Latitude Vegetation Change* and *Earth System Diagnostics* in the section for Polar Terrestrial Environmental Systems at the Alfred-Wegener-Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Potsdam. My PhD project focuses on the variability of vegetation and climate in the Arctic and how we can use data science to investigate them. More broadly, I am interested in climate-vegetation interactions, climate change biology, biodiversity, and socio-ecological systems.
